SilentAlice's dotfiles

Zsh config file

`oh-my-zsh` is managed as submodule. I also add zsh-syntax-highlighting and zsh-autosuggestions plugin.

clone this branch and modify path of your ZSH in `.zshrc`. Then enjoy it:

```
git clone --single-branch -b zsh git@github.com:SilentAlice/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
sh setup.sh
```

You need to modify the `ZSH` var in  `zshrc`.
